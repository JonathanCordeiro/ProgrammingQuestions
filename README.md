The file GitStatistics.py is used to generate a report that displays the total and median number of commits, stars, contributors, branches, tags, forks, releases, and closed issues. It uses GitHubs API to achieve this task.
In order to use the script, a user must enter their GitHub personal access token, then enter the name of the user that they wish to gather statistics from.

The file LinkStatus.py is used to determine whether a link in a directory of files is still valid or not. It will return the percentage of valid links and will display which links are valid and which links are invalid.
